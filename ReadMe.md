This is an Ecommerce website developed using HTML and CSS. The home page of the website displays
the main products offered by the company along with their descriptions and prices. Users can
click on any product to be redirected to its detailed page where they will find more information
about that particular item.

The project includes a "style.css", "script.js" file which contains all the styling/functionality for the webpage and a "index.html" file which acts as the main container for the web page content.

To run this program you need to open the "index.html" file in your preferred browser
which should display the eCommerce website's Home Page.
